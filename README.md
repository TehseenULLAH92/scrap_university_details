Here I just made a crawler or bot to scrap the data from the website using NODEJS its a very basic if you want to advance it more then 
you can join me.

Just download or clone the repo like this:

git clone https://github.com/TehseenULLAH92/scrap_university_details.git
and then run the "npm i" in your working directory.

then run node app.js

That's It.

Thanks
